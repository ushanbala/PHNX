btw this is the start of the code

void test(age,name){
    btw we check if the user is a minor or an adult here
    if age<18 {
        console('you are still a child _+name+_');
    }else{
        console(f'Aight you are an adult _+name+_');
    }
}

btw we call the function here

test(18,'ukdzzz');
