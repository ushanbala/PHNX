**PHNX** is a custom programming language crafted using Python that intentionally mirrors the syntax and fundamental code structures of both **Java** and **C#**.

## Overview

Are you a developer familiar with the robust structure of Java or the elegant syntax of C#? PHNX offers a welcoming environment by providing a familiar coding experience. Built on the foundation of Python, PHNX combines the simplicity and flexibility of its underlying language with the structured, object-oriented paradigms you've come to expect from Java and C#.

This makes PHNX a versatile tool for a variety of purposes:

* **Learning:** Newcomers to programming can grasp fundamental concepts through a syntax that echoes widely-used languages.
* **Prototyping:** Quickly build and test ideas leveraging Python's rapid development capabilities within a structured syntax.
* **Transitioning:** Developers moving between Python, Java, and C# can find a comfortable intermediate ground.

With PHNX, you can harness the power and extensive libraries of Python while working with a syntax that feels natural if you have experience with Java or C#.

## Key Features (Implicit from Description)

* **Java-like Syntax:** Expect familiar keywords, class definitions, and potentially method structures reminiscent of Java.
* **C#-like Syntax:** Look for syntax elements common in C#, such as property-like structures or similar control flow statements.
* **Built with Python:** Inherits Python's dynamic typing, ease of use, and access to its vast ecosystem of libraries.
* **Object-Oriented Paradigm:** Supports object-oriented programming principles familiar to Java and C# developers.

## Getting Started (Example - Needs Expansion)

```phnx
void test(age, name) {
    // btw we check if the user is a minor or an adult here
    if age < 18 {
        console('you are still a child _+name+_');
    } else {
        console(f'Aight you are an adult _+name+_');
    }
}

test(18, 'ukdzzz');
